##Learn Markdown
## Text Formatting
- To make a text italic we surround it by underscores like _this_.
- To make a text Bold we surround it by two asterisks like **this**.
- To add a Block-quote use the caret sign before the double quoted sentence:
>"This is a Block-quote."

## Headers
Headers are made using an Hash Symbol, one hash is equivalent to an h1 header in HTML, Two headers an h2 and so on.
## Links
There are two ways we could add a markdown to our page:
**an Inline link**: we wrap the link text in square brackets, and the link/URL in parentheses, like this link to [GitHub](wwww.github.com).
**a Reference link**: ??

## Images
Images can be added using the an exclamation mark before an inline link like this: ![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

## Lists
To use list we use the single star symbol
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

## Numbered lists
we add 1. 2. and so on before our list
1. milk
2. cheese
3. Salt

## Sub-lists
We just add a space before the * symbol
* Tintin is:
 * a human.
 * a hero.
 * a dog owner.
 
## Paragraphs
### Accomplishing soft breaks
To add a soft break between lines, we add two spaces at the end of each line.
We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
